# DISCO:
 * Foundation provides templates for web elements (ex: tables, nav bars, etc) and styling (ex: fonts) for site creation/design 
 * Insert the CDN link into an html file to use Foundation CSS and JavaScript allows you to use Foundation styling without NMP/Yarn 

# QCC:
 * How can we interact with Foundation without NPM/Yarn? (the answer is yes - reference DISCOs)
 * Is there a better documentation for Foundation that goes more into better descriptions of commands/elements and how they relate to each other? The documentation we're referencing is composed mainly of code examples and not much explaination is done.
