# DISCO:
 * 'carousel-item' creates a moving slideshow where you can add text/photos/etc
 *  unlike foundation, bootstrap requires you to import the framework (import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap') in order to use design elements
 * direct link to css file and model(?) script required 

# QCC:
 * what *are* the imports? 
 * why do certain elements like carousel-item require activation? 

# q0: 1
- verbal consultation with neighbouring team on text formatting options 
- referenced bootstrap documentation [offical site]: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/

# q1: 
Aesthetically, bootstrap. Foundation has it's perks (seen in easily digestable and simple code compared to that of bt), but bootstrap seems to be more aimed at design/css, allowing us to create a "prettier" site. 
Since our mission was to create a site to introduce our duckies, we thought that bootstrap had a lot more flexible features.
